# 100 Days of Shaders

This repo contains the source code for what will hopefully be 100 consecutive days of daily shader programming, which I'm doing as a project for Katherine Dillon's 100 Days of Making course at NYU ITP.

For the first week or two, I'll be working through [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com). After that, who knows??

I'll try to spend no more than 30 minutes to an hour on each shader, and I'll document every day by posting on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/orenorenorenoren/) with the hashtag [#100days_ITP](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/100days_ITP/).
